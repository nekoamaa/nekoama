                    <p class="lead open-sans">Yui is a cheerful, outgoing girl who becomes the Service Club's first "customer," asking them to help her bake cookies for "a certain someone." Her problems lie not with her personality, but with her inability to deal with issues by
                        herself. She believes that talent is inborn, and often aspired to be like others until Yukino changed her way of thinking. Following her experience with the Service Club, Yui begins to attend Service Club sessions after school
                        as well, despite Yukino's objections early on.

                    <p class="lead open-sans">Second sister of the Nakano quintuplets. She usually acts as the mother of the family, she cooks for them and takes care of their medical needs. Among the five sisters, she is the one who has the highest hostility towards Fuutarou
                        and often rebels against him. Nino has a sharp tongue and talks bluntly when confronting the others, even if the other party is her sister. She has an outgoing attitude and is socially aware, resulting in her having many friends.
                        She is a scheming person and doesn't hesitate to use underhanded methods to achieve her goals.</p>

                        to him. Miku likes Japanese History (especially Generals from Sengoku Period) and greatly influenced by their philosophies, to the point of affecting her real-life behavior.</p>

                    <p class="lead open-sans">Yukino is the leader of the Service Club, of which she is the sole member until Hachiman joins her. She is smart, beautiful, and is nicknamed the "Ice-cold Beauty" for her icy demeanor. She has a twisted sense of "noblesse oblige",
                        and believes that it is the duty of the exceptional (in other words, herself) to help the "lost lambs" of the world. Her personality often leads her to be disgusted at the naivete of others, particularly Yui's, and she does not
                        hesitate to show it. Despite this, Yui still affectionally calls her "Yukinon."</p>

                        her relaxed exterior and her initial claim of wanting to get along with demons, she can be rather cruel and harbors a great deal of anger towards them. She is generally kind to other humans, but is rather sadistic in her treatment
                        of demons. As a pillar, she is a top-class fighter despite her small stature. She is also well-versed in medical knowledge, and can concoct poisons and medicines alike.</p>
